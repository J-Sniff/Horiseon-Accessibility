# Horiseon-Accessibility-Challenge

## Project Details

Horsieon, a marketing agency, has given the task of making their website more accessible for users that may have disabilities.

### Changes Made

After reviewing the Horiseon website I have concluded that there are accessibilty flaws that need to be addressed. These are the issues that have been addressed.
1. The website was given a more concise **title**.
2. **Alt attributes** were added to image sources.
3. The source code was reviewed for **semantic HTML elements**.
4. Heading attributes fall in **sequential order**.
5. Found that elements follow a **logical structure independent of styling and postioning**.
